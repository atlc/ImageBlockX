# imgBlockX

## What does it do?
It's a switch to toggle whether or not the browser will load images.

## Why?
I like to tether my laptop to my phone, and this way I can ensure my
data will last as long as possible.

I previously used [Image Block](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-block/) but since it has not been converted to a web extension,
I figured I'd learn how to write a web extension and do it myself.
